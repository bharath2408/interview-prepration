## Part-1

1. What are the different data types present in javascript?.

**_Note:_** To know the type of a JavaScript variable, we can use the typeof operator.

1.  Primitive data types

        - **_String_** : It represents a series of characters and is written with quotes. A string can be represented using a single or a double quote

        **_Example:_**

        ```javascript
        var str = "Vivek Singh Bisht"; //using double quotes
        var str2 = "John Doe"; //using single quotes
        ```

        - **_Number_** : It represents a number and can be written with or without decimals.

        **_Example:_**

        ```javascript
        var x = 3; //without decimal
        var y = 3.6; //with decimal
        ```

        - **_BigInt_** : This data type is used to store numbers which are above the limitation of the Number data type. It can store large integers and is represented by adding “n” to an integer literal.

        **_Example:_**

        ```javascript
        var bigInteger = 234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
        ```

        - **_Boolean_** : It represents a logical entity and can have only two values : true or false. Booleans are generally used for conditional testing.

        **_Example:_**

        ```javascript
        var bigInteger = 234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
        ```
